Day 10 – Docker Attached vs Detached Mode & Logs (Summary)

Docker containers can run in attached or detached mode, depending on how they interact with the terminal.

Attached Mode

In attached mode, the container’s stdin, stdout, and stderr are connected to your terminal.

Logs and outputs are displayed in real time.

Useful for:

Debugging

Monitoring logs

Interactive work

Default behavior of docker run.

Example:

docker run nginx


⚠️ Closing the terminal in attached mode stops the container.

Detached Mode

In detached mode, the container runs in the background.

Terminal is free for other tasks.

Ideal for:

Long-running services

Production workloads

Enabled using the -d flag.

Example:

docker run -d nginx


Closing the terminal does not affect the running container.

Using docker start

Starts an existing container.

Default behavior is detached mode.

docker start <container-id-or-name>


To start in attached mode:

docker start -a <container-id-or-name>

Viewing Container Logs

Logs of detached containers can be viewed using:

docker logs <container-id-or-name>


Follow logs in real time:

docker logs -f <container-id-or-name>


Logs can be viewed without stopping the container.

Combining Common Docker Flags

Multiple flags can be used together:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx


Flags explained:

-d → Run in detached mode

-p → Port mapping

--name → Assign custom container name

Important Notes

You cannot switch modes (attached ↔ detached) without stopping and restarting the container.

There is no performance difference between attached and detached modes.

Containers started with docker start default to detached mode unless -a is used.

Key Takeaway

Attached mode is best for real-time interaction and debugging, while detached mode is ideal for background services and production workloads. Logs bridge the gap by allowing monitoring without attaching to the container.

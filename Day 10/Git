Day 10 – Git Merging, Fast-Forward Merges & Cherry-Pick (Summary)

Git merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another, commonly used to integrate feature branches into the main branch.

Merging helps keep the codebase unified and supports collaborative development.

Fast-Forward Merge

A fast-forward merge occurs when the target branch has not diverged from the source branch.

Git simply moves the branch pointer forward to the latest commit instead of creating a new merge commit.

This keeps the commit history linear and clean.

When Fast-Forward Merge Happens

No new commits exist on the target branch since the source branch was created.

The branch histories are linear and conflict-free.

Example: Merging alice_part into main when main hasn’t changed.

Benefits of Fast-Forward Merges

Maintains a simple and readable history.

Avoids unnecessary merge commits.

Faster and more efficient.

Ideal for short-lived feature branches with no parallel development.

Note: For long-running branches or when documenting integration points is important, a regular merge commit may be preferred.

Using git cherry-pick

git cherry-pick applies a specific commit from one branch to another.

Useful when you need only selected changes (e.g., bug fixes) instead of merging an entire branch.

Command:

git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

Executing a Fast-Forward Merge

Switch to the target branch:

git checkout main


Merge the source branch:

git merge alice_part


Verify history:

git log --oneline


If conditions are met, Git performs a fast-forward merge without creating a merge commit.

Key Takeaway

Fast-forward merges keep history clean when branches haven’t diverged, while cherry-pick provides fine-grained control for selectively applying individual commits across branches.

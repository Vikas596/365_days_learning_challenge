Day 11 – Docker Interactive Mode & Container Access (Summary)

Interactive mode allows real-time interaction with a container through the terminal.

It connects:

stdin → keyboard input

stdout → command output

stderr → error messages

Uses a TTY (pseudo-terminal) to provide a full command-line experience.

When to Use Interactive Mode

Best suited for Linux-based images like ubuntu or alpine.

Ideal for:

Development

Testing

Debugging

Installing packages and configuration changes

Not commonly used for service-based images like Nginx, unless entering a shell manually.

Running a Container in Interactive Mode

Use -i to keep input open and -t to allocate a terminal.

Combined as -it.

docker run -it --name my-ubuntu ubuntu


The container provides shell access.

Exiting the shell stops the container if no foreground process exists.

Starting an Existing Container Interactively

Use docker start -ai to reattach to a stopped interactive container.

docker start -ai my-ubuntu

Accessing a Running Container

Use docker exec -it to enter a running container without stopping it.

docker exec -it my-ubuntu /bin/bash


A shell must be specified (/bin/bash or /bin/sh).

Key Takeaway

Interactive mode provides direct shell access to containers, making it essential for hands-on work, debugging, and system-level changes inside containers.

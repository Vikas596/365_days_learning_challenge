Day 11 – Merge Commits & Merge Conflict Handling (Git Summary)

Merge commits are required when branches have diverged, meaning both the feature branch and the target branch contain new commits.

In such cases, Git cannot perform a fast-forward merge and instead creates a merge commit to combine both branches while preserving individual branch histories.

Why Merge Commits Are Important

Support parallel development by multiple contributors.

Maintain accountability by clearly documenting when branches are integrated.

Preserve a traceable, non-linear history useful for debugging and audits.

Performing a Merge Commit

Switch to the target branch and merge the feature branch:

git checkout main
git merge bobs_part


Git creates a merge commit with two parent commits.

A merge commit message records the context of integration.

Understanding Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes.

Common causes:

Multiple contributors modifying the same file or lines.

Long-running or heavily diverged branches.

Example conflict message:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in menu.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Conflict Markers Explained
<<<<<<< HEAD
Current branch changes
=======
Incoming branch changes
>>>>>>> feature-branch


HEAD → current branch

Incoming section → branch being merged

Conflict markers must be removed after resolution.

Resolving Merge Conflicts

Check conflicted files:

git status


Edit files and resolve conflicts manually.

Stage resolved files:

git add <filename>


Complete the merge:

git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

Key Takeaway

Merge commits preserve complete development history when branches diverge, while proper conflict resolution ensures clean and collaborative workflows.

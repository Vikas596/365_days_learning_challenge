Day 13 – Discarding & Unstaging Changes in Git (Summary)

While working on a project, it’s common to make unwanted or experimental changes.

Git provides safe and flexible ways to discard changes or remove files from the staging area without affecting other work.

Discarding Unwanted Changes

Uncommitted changes in the working directory can be reverted back to the last committed state.

This helps maintain a clean and stable codebase.

Using git checkout to Revert Changes

Reverts a file to its state in the last commit.

Discards all local, uncommitted changes in that file.

git checkout HEAD <file>
git checkout -- <file>

Using git restore (Recommended)

git restore is a dedicated command for undoing changes.

It avoids confusion caused by git checkout, which has multiple purposes.

git restore <file>


Restores the file to its last committed state.

Restoring from a Specific Commit
git restore --source=HEAD~2 <file>


Restores the file as it was two commits ago.

Unstaging Files (Without Losing Changes)

Sometimes files are staged accidentally or prematurely.

git restore --staged removes files from staging but keeps changes intact.

git restore --staged <file>


Multiple files can be unstaged at once.

Using git status as a Guide

git status shows:

Current branch

Staged files

Unstaged files

Suggested next commands

Acts as a built-in helper for managing changes safely.

Key Takeaway

Git allows you to undo safely and precisely—whether discarding unwanted changes or unstaging files—helping you keep commits clean and intentional.

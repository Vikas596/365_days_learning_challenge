Day 14 – Docker --rm Option & Automatic Container Cleanup (Summary)

The --rm option in Docker helps manage container lifecycles by automatically removing containers once they stop.

It prevents unused or stopped containers from piling up and consuming system resources.

Why --rm Is Important

Keeps the Docker environment clean and clutter-free.

Eliminates the need for manual container removal.

Ideal for temporary, short-lived containers.

Improves workflow efficiency during development and automation.

Using --rm with docker run

When used with docker run, the container is:

Created

Started

Automatically deleted after it stops

docker run --rm --name my-nginx nginx


Once the container stops, it is removed automatically.

The container will not appear in docker ps -a.

Using --rm with docker create

You can also apply --rm during container creation.

The container will be removed after it is stopped.

docker create --rm --name my-nginx nginx
docker start my-nginx

Real-World Use Cases

Development & Testing: Running short-lived scripts or experiments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automatic cleanup after test execution.

One-time Tasks: Batch jobs, debugging sessions, or isolated checks.

Key Takeaway

The --rm option is best suited for ephemeral containers where persistence is not required, ensuring a clean and efficient Docker environment.

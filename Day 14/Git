Day 14 – Git Reset & Revert (Undoing Changes Correctly) – Summary

Git provides multiple ways to undo changes depending on whether you want to rewrite history or preserve it.

The two most important commands for this are git reset and git revert.

Understanding git reset

git reset moves the HEAD pointer back to a specific commit.

All commits after that point are removed from commit history.

The actual file changes may remain staged, unstaged, or be deleted depending on the reset type.

Best used for local commits that have not been pushed.

Types of git reset
Reset Type	Commits Removed	Changes Staged	Changes in Working Directory
Mixed (default)	Yes	No	Yes
Soft	Yes	Yes	Yes
Hard	Yes	No	No

Soft reset → uncommit but keep changes staged

Mixed reset → uncommit and unstage changes

Hard reset → completely discard commits and changes (dangerous)

Understanding git revert

git revert undoes changes by creating a new commit.

It does not rewrite history.

Safe for shared and collaborative repositories.

Only the selected commit is reverted; later commits remain unchanged.

git revert <commit-hash>

Reset vs Revert

Use git reset:

For local work

Before pushing commits

When rewriting history is safe

Use git revert:

For shared branches

When history must remain traceable

In team environments

Key Takeaway

git reset is powerful but risky because it rewrites history, while git revert is safer and preferred in collaborative projects.

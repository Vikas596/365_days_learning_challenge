Day 15 – Docker Pruning Commands (Cleanup & Optimization) – Summary

Docker provides pruning commands to remove unused resources and keep the system clean, fast, and efficient.

Over time, stopped containers, unused images, and build cache can consume significant disk space.

Pruning helps reclaim resources and maintain a healthy Docker environment.

Why Docker Pruning Is Important

Improves system performance

Frees disk space

Reduces environment clutter

Simplifies container and image management

Docker Pruning Commands Overview
1️⃣ docker container prune

Removes all stopped containers

Does not affect running containers

docker container prune


Prompts for confirmation before deletion.

Useful for routine cleanup after testing or development.

2️⃣ docker image prune

Removes dangling images (untagged images).

With -a, removes all unused images (not linked to running containers).

docker image prune
docker image prune -a


Helps maintain a clean image repository.

3️⃣ docker system prune

Performs a full cleanup:

Stopped containers

Dangling images

Unused networks

Build cache

docker system prune
docker system prune -a


-a removes all unused images, not just dangling ones.

Most powerful cleanup command (use carefully).

Key Takeaway

Docker pruning commands help maintain a lean and optimized environment, especially useful during development, testing, and CI/CD workflows.

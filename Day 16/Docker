Day 16 – Docker docker cp Command (File Transfer) – Summary

The docker cp command allows you to copy files and directories between a Docker container and the host machine.

It works in both directions:

Host → Container

Container → Host

This command is useful when you need to:

Inject configuration files into containers

Extract logs, reports, or generated data

Debug or inspect container output without rebuilding images

Basic Syntax
docker cp <source_path> <destination_path>


<source_path> can be:

A host path

A container path (container-name:/path)

<destination_path> can also be on the host or inside a container.

You can reference containers using container name or container ID.

Copying Files from Host to Container

Used when you want to move files into a running container.

docker cp host_test_file.txt ubuntu-container:/container_file_path.txt


Copies host_test_file.txt from host into the container.

Useful for:

Adding test files

Updating configs

Debugging containers

Copying Files from Container to Host

Used when you want to extract files from a container.

docker cp ubuntu-container:/container_test_file.txt host_file_path.txt


Copies files from container to host.

Useful for:

Retrieving logs

Exporting generated files

Debugging application output

Tips & Best Practices

Always verify paths (both source and destination).

Use docker ps to ensure the container exists and is accessible.

Watch out for file permissions when copying files.

Works for both running and stopped containers.

Key Takeaway

docker cp is a simple yet powerful tool for transferring files between host and containers without rebuilding images or using volumes.

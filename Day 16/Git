Day 16 – Git Remote Repositories, Origin & Push (Summary)

A remote repository is a version of your project hosted online (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Remote repositories enable collaboration, allowing multiple developers to share and sync changes.

Understanding origin

origin is the default name Git assigns to the remote repository when you clone a project.

It represents the main remote source of your project.

git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git


After cloning:

origin points to the URL you cloned from.

Used as shorthand for fetch and push operations.

Viewing Remote Repositories

To check which remotes are connected to your local repository:

git remote -v


Shows:

Fetch URL → where updates are downloaded from

Push URL → where your commits are uploaded to

Managing Remotes

Add a new remote repository:

git remote add <name> <url>


Example:

git remote add main-repo https://github.com/user/repository.git


Remove an existing remote:

git remote rm <name>


Useful when:

Working with forks

Migrating repositories

Managing multiple remotes

Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

Pushing uploads local commits to a remote repository.

Makes your work available to collaborators.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name>


Common usage:

git push origin main


Pushes local main branch commits to origin/main.

Key Takeaway

Remote repositories connect local work to shared projects. Understanding origin, managing remotes, and pushing correctly are fundamental to collaboration in Git.

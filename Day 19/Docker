🐳 Day 19 – Understanding Docker Bind Mounts (Repo Summary)

Today I learned about Docker Bind Mounts, which allow mapping a specific directory from the host machine directly into a Docker container.

Bind mounts create a direct link between host and container directories, enabling real-time data synchronization. Unlike Docker volumes (named or anonymous), bind mounts are not managed by Docker and depend on exact host paths.

Bind mounts are especially useful in:

Development environments

Live code editing

Accessing existing host files inside containers

Any change made inside the container is immediately reflected on the host, and vice versa, making bind mounts ideal when instant data consistency is required.

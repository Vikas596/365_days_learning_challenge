📘 Day 19 – Understanding git diff (Repo Summary)

Today I learned how to use git diff to inspect and review changes in a Git repository before committing, staging, or merging code.

git diff is a powerful command that helps compare different states of a repository, such as:

Working directory vs last commit

Staged changes vs last commit

One branch vs another branch

One commit vs another commit

I also understood how to read and interpret diff output, including:

+ lines → added content

- lines → removed content

@@ markers → affected line ranges

How Git represents new files and deleted files

Using git diff improves code quality, avoids accidental commits, and ensures a clean and controlled Git history.

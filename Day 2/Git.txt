Git Learning – Initial Setup & First Commit

Created a new directory named my-time-machine using the command mkdir my-time-machine.

Navigated into the directory using cd my-time-machine (used Tab autocomplete to quickly complete the directory name).

Initialized a new Git repository in the current directory using git init.

Checked the repository status using git status.

Created a new file (message.txt) and added some content to it.

Verified the file content using the cat command.

Staged the file for commit using git add message.txt.

Made the first commit with a meaningful commit message using git commit -m.

Viewed the commit history using the git log command.

🐳 Day 20 – Docker Volume Cleanup & Management (Repo Summary)

Today I learned how to identify, inspect, and clean up unused Docker volumes to keep the Docker environment clean, efficient, and optimized.

Unused volumes are usually created when containers are removed but their volumes are left behind. Over time, these volumes consume disk space and create clutter.

I worked with the following commands:

Used docker volume ls to list all Docker volumes.

Used docker volume ls -f dangling=true to identify unused (dangling) volumes.

Removed a specific named volume using docker volume rm <volume-name>.

Removed anonymous volumes using their volume IDs with docker volume rm <volume-id>.

Cleaned up all unused anonymous volumes using docker volume prune.

Performed a complete cleanup of all unused volumes (named + anonymous) using docker volume prune -a.

These commands help maintain better storage management, cleaner Docker setups, and improved system performance.

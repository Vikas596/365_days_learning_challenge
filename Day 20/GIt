📘 Day 20 – Understanding Git Rebase (Repo Summary with Commands)

Today I learned about Git Rebasing, a technique used to keep a clean and linear commit history by replaying commits from one branch onto another.

I practiced rebasing a feature branch onto the main branch using:

git checkout feature/blog to switch to the feature branch.

git rebase main to replay feature branch commits on top of the latest main.

During rebasing, I understood that:

Git rewrites commit history and generates new commit hashes.

If conflicts occur, Git pauses the rebase process.

Conflicts are resolved manually, staged using git add <file>, and continued with git rebase --continue.

If something goes wrong, the rebase can be canceled using git rebase --abort.

I also compared merge vs rebase:

git merge main preserves branch history using a merge commit.

git rebase main creates a linear history without merge commits.

To visualize how rebasing and merging affect history, I used:

git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate to see commit flow and branching structure.

I learned that rebasing should be used only on local or private branches, and should be avoided on shared or already pushed branches to prevent collaboration issues.

🚀 Day 21 – Docker Networks (Repo Summary)

Today I learned how Docker networks control communication between containers and the internet.

🔹 What I understood

Docker networks define how containers talk to each other and external services

By default, containers use the bridge network

Bridge network provides:

Private communication between containers on the same host

Internet access via NAT

Docker handles DNS resolution automatically using host DNS

Internet connectivity inside containers can be tested using lightweight images like Alpine

Containers can be fully isolated from the network using --network none

🔹 Key Docker Network Concepts

Bridge network → Internet access + container-to-container communication

DNS inside container → Resolves domain names like google.com

Network isolation → Achieved using --network none

📌 Key Takeaway:
Docker networking controls connectivity, isolation, and security. Understanding bridge and none networks is essential for real-world container setups.

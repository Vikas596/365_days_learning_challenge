📘 Day 21 – Git Interactive Rebase (Repo Summary)
🔹 Topic: Interactive Rebase (git rebase -i)

Interactive rebase is a powerful Git feature that allows you to rewrite and clean commit history in a controlled and intentional way. It helps transform a messy or noisy commit log into a clear, logical, and linear history before merging code.

Using interactive rebase, you can:

Fix commit message typos

Combine related commits

Reorder commits logically

Remove unnecessary or wrong commits

🔹 Starting an Interactive Rebase

To edit recent commits, interactive rebase is started using:

git rebase -i HEAD~N


Example:

git rebase -i HEAD~7


This opens the last 7 commits in an editor and allows you to decide what to do with each commit.

🔹 Common Interactive Rebase Commands (Used Inside Editor)
pick    → keep commit as-is
reword  → change commit message
edit    → modify commit content
squash  → combine commit with previous one (keep messages)
fixup   → combine commit and discard message
drop    → delete commit completely

🔹 Fixing a Commit Message (Reword)

To correct a typo in a recent commit message:
git rebase -i HEAD~2


Change:

pick <commit-hash>


to:

reword <commit-hash>


This updates the commit message and rewrites the commit hash.

🔹 Combining Commits (Squash / Fixup)

To combine multiple related commits into one:

git rebase -i HEAD~4


Change the second commit to:

squash <commit-hash>


or:

fixup <commit-hash>


This creates a single, clean commit for related changes.

🔹 Removing Unwanted Commits (Drop)

To remove an unnecessary commit from history:

git rebase -i HEAD~1


Change:

pick <commit-hash>


to:

drop <commit-hash>


This removes the commit and its changes completely.

🔹 Handling Conflicts During Rebase

If conflicts occur:

git add <file>
git rebase --continue


To cancel rebase completely:

git rebase --abort

🔹 Visualizing Commit History

To clearly understand how rebase changes history:

git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate

🔹 Key Takeaway

Interactive rebase is best used before pushing code or on feature branches. It helps maintain a clean, readable history but should be avoided on shared or already-pushed branches.

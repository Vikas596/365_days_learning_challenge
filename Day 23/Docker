📅 Day 23 – Docker Network Management
📌 Overview

Today I learned about Docker Network Management, which is essential for controlling communication between containers and maintaining an organized Docker environment. I explored commands used to list, inspect, remove, and clean unused Docker networks.

🧠 Technologies Learned

Docker Networking

Network Management Commands

🔍 Listing Docker Networks

To view all available Docker networks:

docker network ls

✅ Purpose

Displays all networks along with:

Network ID

Network Name

Driver

Scope

🧱 Default Docker Networks

Docker automatically creates three networks:

Network	Description
bridge	Default private network allowing container-to-container communication
host	Uses host machine network directly
none	Disables networking completely
🔎 Inspecting Docker Networks

To view detailed information about a network:

docker network inspect <network_name>

✅ Provides Details About

Network driver

Subnet and gateway configuration

Connected containers

Container IP addresses

💡 Use Case

Helpful for troubleshooting and verifying container connectivity.

❌ Removing Docker Networks

To remove a specific Docker network:

docker network rm <network_name>

⚠️ Important Note

Network cannot be removed if containers are connected.

Containers must be stopped or disconnected first.

🧹 Pruning Unused Networks

To remove all unused networks:

docker network prune

✅ Purpose

Removes networks not used by any running container

Keeps Docker environment clean and optimized

💡 Additional Tip
docker system prune


Also removes unused networks along with containers, images, and other unused resources.

🚀 Key Learnings

Docker provides built-in default networks.

Network inspection helps understand container communication.

Removing unused networks improves system efficiency.

Proper network management is important in real-world containerized applications.

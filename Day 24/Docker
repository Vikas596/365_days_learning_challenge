📅 Day 24 – Docker Network Connect & Disconnect
📌 Overview

Today I learned how to dynamically manage container network connectivity using Docker. These commands allow containers to join or leave networks without stopping them, which is very useful in multi-container and microservices environments.

🔗 Connecting a Container to a Network
✅ Command
docker network connect <network_name> <container_name_or_id>

📖 Description

This command connects a running container to a specified Docker network. After connecting, the container can communicate with other containers present in that network.

💡 Use Cases

Multi-container application communication

Adding services dynamically

Expanding application architecture without restarting containers

🧪 Example
docker network connect frontend_network web_container


👉 The container web_container will now join frontend_network and communicate with containers inside that network.

🔌 Disconnecting a Container from a Network
✅ Command
docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name_or_id>

📖 Description

This command removes a container from a specific Docker network while keeping the container running.

💡 Use Cases

Security isolation

Network architecture changes

Maintenance or troubleshooting

Limiting container communication

🧪 Example
docker network disconnect frontend_network web_container


👉 The container web_container will stop communicating with containers in frontend_network.

🔍 Verifying Network Connection
✅ Command
docker network inspect <network_name>

📖 Description

Displays detailed network information including:

Connected containers

Container IP addresses

Network configuration

Subnet and gateway details

💡 Use Case

Helps verify whether containers are correctly connected or disconnected from networks.

🚀 Key Learnings

Containers can join multiple networks dynamically.

Containers can leave networks without stopping execution.

Proper network management improves security and communication control.

Network inspection helps troubleshoot connectivity issues.

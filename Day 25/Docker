📅 Day 25 – Repo Summary
📌 Overview

Today I learned about Docker Compose, a tool used to manage multi-container applications. It allows multiple services like web servers, databases, and caches to run together using a single configuration file called docker-compose.yml.

Docker Compose simplifies container orchestration, improves consistency, and reduces manual configuration.

🐳 What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multiple containers as a single application using a YAML configuration file.

✅ Benefits

Simplified multi-container management

Single configuration file

Easy orchestration

Consistent development and production environments

📄 Docker Compose Configuration File
✅ File Name
docker-compose.yml

🧱 Key Components
version

Defines Compose file syntax version.

services

Defines containers required for the application.

image

Specifies Docker image for the service.

ports

Maps container ports to host ports.

environment

Defines environment variables inside container.

🧪 Example Compose File
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: abcd1234

▶️ Running Docker Compose Services
✅ Command
docker compose up

📖 Description

Starts all services defined in the Compose file. It pulls images, creates containers, networks, and starts services.

💡 Use Cases

Running full application stack

Local development setup

Microservices deployment

📊 Viewing Running Services
✅ Command
docker compose ps

📖 Description

Shows running services with status and container details.

✅ Command
docker compose ps -a

📖 Description

Shows all services including stopped ones.

🔍 Viewing Container Details
✅ Command
docker ps

📖 Description

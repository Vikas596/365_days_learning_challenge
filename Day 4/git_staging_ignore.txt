Day 4 – Git Staging Area & Change Management

Today, I practiced how Git handles files before committing, focusing on the staging area, ignored files, viewing changes, and unstaging.

🔹 What I did today

Created a new lab directory and initialized a Git repository:

mkdir git-staging-lab
cd git-staging-lab
git init


Created a Python file and added it to the staging area:

echo "print('Hello, Git!')" > hello.py
git add hello.py
git status


Learned how Git shows staged files using git status.

Created a .gitignore file to ignore log files:

echo "*.log" > .gitignore
echo "This is a log file" > debug.log


Verified that ignored files are not tracked by Git:

git status


Added .gitignore to staging and committed changes:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Initial commit with hello.py and .gitignore"


Modified the tracked file and checked changes before committing:

git diff


Unstaged a file without losing changes:

git restore --staged hello.py

🧠 Key takeaway

The staging area allows precise control over what goes into a commit, helping maintain clean and meaningful commit history.

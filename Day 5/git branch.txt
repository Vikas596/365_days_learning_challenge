Day 5 – Git Branching & Merging (Hands-on)

Today I practiced Git branching, switching branches, merging, and cleaning up branches using a real lab setup.

🔹 What I did today
1️⃣ Repository Setup
mkdir git-branch-lab
cd git-branch-lab
git init

2️⃣ Create Initial Files
echo "# Git Branch Lab" > README.md
echo "This is my hub for multiversal Git branch experiments" >> README.md

3️⃣ Create and View Branches
git branch feature-dimension
git branch


Output:

  feature-dimension
* master


➡ * indicates the current branch (master).

4️⃣ Switch to Feature Branch
git checkout feature-dimension
# OR (recommended newer command)
git switch feature-dimension

5️⃣ Create New File in Feature Branch
echo "This is a powerful artifact from another dimension" > dimensional-artifact.txt
git add dimensional-artifact.txt
git commit -m "Create a powerful interdimensional artifact"

6️⃣ Update README in Feature Branch
echo "#### Feature Dimension" >> README.md
echo "We've discovered a powerful artifact in this reality" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Document the discovery of the artifact"

7️⃣ Merge Feature Branch into Master
git checkout master
git merge feature-dimension


Merge Output:

Fast-forward
 README.md                 | 2 ++
 dimensional-artifact.txt | 1 +

8️⃣ Verify Merged Content
cat dimensional-artifact.txt
cat README.md

9️⃣ Delete Feature Branch
git branch -d feature-dimension

🧠 Key Takeaway

Branches allow safe experimentation. Once changes are tested and ready, they can be merged cleanly into the main branch.

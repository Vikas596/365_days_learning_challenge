Day 6 – Git Internals, History & Fixing Commits (Summary)

Running git init creates the hidden .git folder, which is the core of a Git repository. It stores all data required to track changes and history.

Important parts inside .git:

HEAD → Points to the current branch/commit.

config → Repository-specific configuration settings.

objects/ → Stores commits, files, and changes in compressed form.

refs/ → Tracks branches and tags.

logs/ → Records movement of HEAD and branch history.

You usually don’t touch .git directly, but understanding it helps you grasp how Git works internally.

.gitignore is used to exclude files or folders you don’t want Git to track (logs, temp files, build artifacts, etc.).

The .gitignore file should be committed so all contributors follow the same ignore rules.

git log helps you view the commit history:

Displays commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

Each commit has a unique hash used to identify it.

(HEAD -> main) means HEAD is pointing to the latest commit on the main branch.

Advanced git log usage:

git log -n 3 → Show the last 3 commits.

git log --author="Name" → Filter commits by author.

git log --grep="keyword" → Search commits by message content.

git commit --amend is used to fix the most recent commit:

Allows you to edit the last commit message or add missing staged changes.

Rewrites the previous commit instead of creating a new one.

Should be used only for local commits that haven’t been pushed to a remote repository.

Avoid using it after pushing, as it rewrites history and can cause confusion for others.

👉 Key takeaway:
Day 6 focuses on understanding Git’s internal structure, managing ignored files, exploring commit history efficiently, and correcting recent mistakes cleanly using git commit --amend.

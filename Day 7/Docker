Day 7 – Docker Hub & Container Lifecycle (Summary)

Docker Hub is a centralized online repository used to find, pull, and share Docker images. It allows developers to use pre-built images for applications like web servers and databases without creating images from scratch.

docker run creates and starts a container in one step:

Checks if the image exists locally.

Pulls the image from Docker Hub if missing.

Creates a container from the image.

Starts the container immediately.

docker pull is used to download images explicitly from Docker Hub (or another registry) without running them.

Creating a container:

docker create <image> creates a container but does not start it.

You can assign a custom name using --name for easier management.

Created containers appear with the status Created when checked using docker ps -a.

Starting a container:

docker start <container_name|container_id> starts an existing container.

Unlike docker run, it does not create a new container.

Stopping a container:

docker stop <container_name|container_id> safely stops a running container.

👉 Key takeaway:
Docker Hub provides ready-to-use images, while Docker commands like run, pull, create, start, and stop help manage the full lifecycle of a container efficiently.

Day 8 – Dockerfile & Custom Image Creation (Summary)

A Dockerfile is a text file containing a set of instructions used to build a Docker image.

It must be named Dockerfile (capital D, no extension) so Docker can automatically detect it during the build process.

Core Dockerfile Instructions

FROM → Defines the base image (starting point) for your image. Every Dockerfile begins with this instruction.

RUN → Executes commands during the image build process (e.g., installing packages or updating the system).

COPY → Copies files from the host machine into the image’s filesystem.

CMD → Defines the default command that runs when the container starts (not during build).

Dockerfile Placement

Best practice is to place the Dockerfile at the root of the project directory.

Keeping the Dockerfile and required files together ensures Docker has the correct build context.

Building a Custom Docker Image

docker build is used to create an image from a Dockerfile.

The -t flag assigns a tag/name to the image for easier management.

The . (dot) specifies the current directory as the build context.

Example:

docker build -t custom-nginx .

Key Takeaway

A Dockerfile allows you to define application environments as code, making image creation repeatable, consistent, and version-controlled—a core concept in modern DevOps workflows.

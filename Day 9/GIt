Day 9 – Managing Unstaged Changes, Stash & Branch Maintenance

Unstaged changes are modifications in the working directory that have not been added to the staging area using git add.

Switching branches with unstaged changes can lead to conflicts, overwritten work, or confusion if not handled carefully.

Handling Unstaged Changes When Switching Branches

If modified files exist in the target branch, changes may be overwritten.

If modified files do not exist in the target branch, changes usually remain, but should still be reviewed carefully.

Best practice: stash or save changes before switching branches.

Using git stash for Safe Branch Switching

git stash temporarily saves work-in-progress changes and cleans the working directory.

Useful when:

Work is incomplete and not ready to commit.

Switching branches for urgent fixes.

Maintaining a clean commit history.

Stash Commands

git stash → Stash tracked files.

git stash -u → Stash tracked + untracked files.

git stash list → View all stashed entries.

git stash apply → Reapply latest stash without removing it.

git stash pop → Reapply and remove the stash.

git stash apply stash@{n} → Apply a specific stash.

git stash clear → Remove all stashes.

Branch Maintenance

Delete a merged branch safely:

git branch -d <branch-name>


Force delete an unmerged branch (use carefully):

git branch -D <branch-name>

Renaming Branches

Rename the current branch:

git branch -m <new-branch-name>


Rename another branch:

git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>

Key Takeaway

Proper handling of unstaged changes and effective use of git stash ensures safe context switching, while branch deletion and renaming help maintain a clean and organized repository.
